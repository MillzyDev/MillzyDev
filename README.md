Hey there! I'm a developer who makes stuff for fun... mostly.

## My Coding History
### Node.JS & Discord API
I began my "coding journey" during lockdown in 2020, where i started to learn how to make discord bots with Node.JS, i didnt really bother to learn JavaScript and I really just picked it up as I went along. I had completed many project most of which were deleted due to them just taking up space and me not really doing anything with them.
### Java pt. 1
After a while of Node.JS development I began to look towards a proper Object Oriented language, while JS does have Object Oriented features it wasnt really usefull for making desktop apps and Minecraft Mods and Plugins. I began learning Java in my free time i eventually lost my motivation to keep learning it and eventually gave up.
### C++ and Beat Saber
I invested in an Oculus Quest sometime in mid 2020 and played BeatSaber alot, I eventually modded the game and was so inspired by the talented developers and the fruits of their labour. I wanted to make some of my own Beat Saber mods, so i dropped a message in #quest-mod-dev in the BSMG Discord Server that said "i want to give a go at making my own mod, what language should i use and what libs/packs do i need? im assuming something like C# or C++". I began learning C++ in my free time, after some time i released my first mod "LOLCAT BMBF". It was a basic mod that just replaced text with its equivalent in Minecraft's Lolcat language. I eventually deleted it and moved onto my first serious mod, "Tweakaroo". Twekaroo was some random changes to the game Boopety Doopety and I came up with. We eventually released it and it got some decent attention, it was very buggy however and I couldnt think why. The project is on hold at the moment until I pick up the passion for the project again.

I've Began to work on more complex mods like StreamerQtils and AssetDownloader as well as some other simpler ones like PausePlus and Skrypt.
### Java pt. 2 and C#
I picked up learning Java again and I've also been learning C# along with it. I've been doing this in my spare time and I've been sing my Java Knowledge to make more usefull applications like my Java Score Saber API Wrapper (JSSA) and It's C++ equivalent, SSAXX. Not much else has been done on this front as of yet, but i will continue to work on and maintain many of my projects for the forseeable future.
